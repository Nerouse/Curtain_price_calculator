Project description:

This c++ program was created to help with cacuations one might face in the curtain and drape industry.
It helps calculate the total cost of multiple types of windows by just entering the width and height.


Things that can be improved:
Some ideas that can be implemented to this code is an option to scrap an entry becasue of a mistake.
If the user enters the wrong input, there should be a way to fix that and take that out the total calculation.
